# IPL Win Probability Predictor

## Project Description

The IPL Win Probability Predictor is a machine learning model designed to dynamically forecast the chances of victory for cricket teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL) after every over. Leveraging advanced statistical algorithms and historical match data, the model calculates and updates the winning probabilities for both competing teams in real-time. By incorporating various factors such as runs scored, wickets taken, and other game-changing events, the model provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the evolving dynamics during an IPL match.

This innovative approach enhances the viewing experience for cricket enthusiasts and offers strategic insights for teams and analysts. The continuous prediction updates after each over contribute to a nuanced understanding of the game's progression, making the IPL Win Probability Predictor a valuable tool for both cricket enthusiasts and professionals involved in the sport.
